# 6. Conclusion

This Paper doesn’t go in-depth on all the fun mechanisms of the game, a game that aims to be enjoyable by everyone as many Web 2 players as Web 3 degens. These are beeer shown than wrieen about so stay tuned for our game trailers and get ready to play the Alpha earlier than you might think. We didn’t expand either on all our UX plans to make the game as smoothless as possible, in a way that Web 2 guys won’t even know they are already holders. Neither did we talk about what lies beyond the Great Galactic Line nor the story of the lost races. Galactic Kingdom is still full of mysteries and this paper only focused on what are the benefits of owning a Genesis Conqueror in the great world of Galactic Kingdom.

Overall Galactic Kingdom has the ambition to give its Genesis holders real utilities, making them really share the success of the game, having them being the main actors of our User Acquisition, and leyng them have fun in a healthy way, in a healthy economy, and maybe with life-changing treasures.

We believe that having a game from holders through holders for holders will enable us to reach even the most reticent gamers by showing the real power of Web 3 ownership, and all its advantages when used the right way.

So to summarize Galactic Kingdom Genesis Conquerors will have:

<ul>
    <li>
        Real Sustainable Utilities with shared sinks
    </li>
    <li>
        Solid Tokenomics with BTC-backed in-game currency
    </li>
    <li>
        Great Go-to-market strategy with integrated affiliate marketing in the game economy
    </li>
    <li>
        A simple but fun mobile game with endless possibilities, thrilling baeles, and wonderful treasures
    </li>
</ul>
