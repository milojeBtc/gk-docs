# c. Alliances, Guilds & Factions

There are 3 Factions in the game. Each Conqueror will be randomly assigned one faction from the beginning.

Later on, at a higher level, he will be able to pay to change his factions. 

The Galactic Marines: all the conquerors who are obeying the Galactic Government and ensuring « peace » in the universe.

The Galactic Revolutionary: all the conquerors who rebelled against the Galactic Government and aimed to overthrow them.

The Galactic Pirates: all the non-affiliated conquerors just aiming to find clues to get that One Peace and become the King of the Ancient Great Galactic Kingdom’s heir.

Aside from the pirates, the conquerors of each faction generally can’t attack one of their own.

However, with very valuable resources at stake during each battle, everything will be more than exciting and you’d rather not rely on your faction affiliation alone.

That’s where guilds will come into play: players can get together and form guilds regardless of their faction and then even alliances between guilds to be ready in case of a new Intergalactic War. These will play an important part in protecting yourself from other Conquerors’ attacks or in attacking adversaries you wouldn’t be able to handle on your own.

A platform to create and rule guilds and alliances will be available in-game to automatize everything.
