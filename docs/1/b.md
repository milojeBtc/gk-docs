# b. Build, Battle, Explore, Conquer 

After this short introduction, here are the core features of Galactic Kingdom gameplay:
Build, Battle, Explore, Conquer.

Each player will have a Conqueror, a Planet, and a Mothership. In the beginning, the player will build facilities on his planet. The first and most important one is the Galactic Sea Stone(GSS) Miner.

GSS will be presented later on in this paper but it is the resource that will be needed for any construction going forward. Once enough GSS is gathered players will be able to build other types of facilities like, for example, a Shipyard to create spaceships or a Defense System to produce defense weapons and defend your planet.

As soon as the player has built his first spaceship, he will be able to either go attack another player and try to steal his valuable resources or take the game out IRL to go on an exploration expedition on the  Great Galactic Line to try and find treasures of all sorts and conquer new planets.

This is the core game loop.

From a future game asset ownerâ€™s interest, to be even simpler: Build and Battle in a space like Clash of Clans, Explore and Go out in a space like Pokemon Go/StepN then Conquer and Expand your empire in a new unique way.
