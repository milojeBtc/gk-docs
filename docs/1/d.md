# d. Artificial Intelligence

Galactic Kingdom will naturally seek to make the most efficient use of every technology available, going from where and when we use blockchain to the use of Artificial Intelligence. With the recent progress of AI, many projects will ride the AI hype wave without making any real use of it. Galactic Kingdom aims to stand apart and use AI where it makes sense and has a great and fun impact. 

AI is already greatly used in the development of our game which will allow us to deliver playable test versions of our game much sooner than what the old rigid studios used us to. 

One idea we had is very simple on paper but might take much more time than it seems given the huge value that will be at stake: in the long run we want the Galactic Government account to be fully controlled by Artificial Intelligence, making it the main antagonist of the game. More on the Galactic Government's purpose is written about later in this paper.
