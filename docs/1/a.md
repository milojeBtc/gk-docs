# a. The lore 

“ « Only one life that will soon be past, only ONE PEACE that will ever last ». 
It is said that these were the last and only words ever found written by the late King of the Ancient Great Galactic Kingdom. 

To this day nobody knows neither where nor when these words were found, not even who first spread them.

But some say that in reality, that ONE PEACE he talked about is a gigantic treasure capable of shaking the universe that was hidden on the huge unexplored part of the universe: The Great Galactic Line.

Well for me, I don’t know. I’m not even sure who I am, all I know is that from the day I opened my eyes till now, the Galactic Government was ruling the universe. We were all raised by robots who always repeated the same story « After thousand years of war the Galactic Government finally brought peace to the universe and united the four great galaxies East G, South G, North G, and West G. The Galactic Government paid a great price for this peace and now you are the only one remaining. You’ll conquer the Universe. You are the Genesis Conquerors » “
