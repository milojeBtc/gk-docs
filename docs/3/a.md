# a. Motherships

The mothership is the main ship of a conqueror. Each conqueror will have one. Every spaceship built by a shipyard on the planet owned by a conqueror will be linked to the mothership. Motherships will have levels and rarities but wonâ€™t automatically be NFTs. That is where Genesis Motherships will have their shared sink utility. Each mothership will have the possibility to change rarity by using Genesis Mothership Blueprints these will mainly be produced by Genesis Motherships or be earned sometimes in a GTC found during an exploration expedition on the Great Galactic Line. Each Mothership will have a level, rarity, and attributes. The attributes are the following:

<ul>
    <li>
        Control (C): this attribute will determine the number of spaceships your mothership can control
    </li>
    <li>
        Power (P): this attribute will increase the fleet attack point
    </li>
    <li>
        Defense (D): this attribute will increase the fleet defense point
    </li>
</ul>

Here is a table defining the initial attribute  points by rarity:

|Rarity|Minimun attribute|Maximun attribute |New point per level|
|-------------|------|--------|----|
|**Basic(Non-NFT)**|1|5|4|
|**Common**|1|10|6|
|**Uncommon**|9|20|8|
|**Rare**|18|40|10|
|**Epic**|36|80|12|
|**Legendary**|72|160|14|

Genesis Motherships have the same rarity but start from common. The only real difference between Genesis motherships and non-genesis motherships is the shared sink utility.

Each rarity of Genesis motherships will be able to regularly produce Genesis Mothership Blueprints (GMB) that others will want to buy to try and make their mothership rarer and thus more powerful.

Here below a table to summarize the probability of changing your Mothership rarity:

|GMB Rarity|Common Outcome|Uncommon Outcome|Rare Outcome|Epic Outcome|Legendary|
|-------------|------|--------|----|----|----|
|**Common**|96%|2%|1%|0.9%|0.1%|
|**Uncommon**|40%|55%|3%|1.8%|0.2%|
|**Rare**|30%|40%|27%|2%|1%|
|**Epic**|23%|27%|35%|13.5%|2.5%|
|**Legendary**|20%|22%|25%|28%|5%|

The number of GMBs needed to try Mothership evolution is as follows:

|Rarity of mothership|Common GMB|Uncommon GMB|Rare GMB|Epic GMB|Legendary GMB|
|-------------|------|--------|----|----|----|
|**Common**|5|6|7|8|9|
|**Uncommon**|4|5|6|7|8|
|**Rare**|3|4|5|6|7|
|**Epic**|2|3|4|5|6|
|**Legendary**|1|2|3|4|5|


The Mothership Evolution Process (MEP) will cost $GB and use as many GMBs as needed. Even Genesis Motherships can try the MEP at their own risk.
