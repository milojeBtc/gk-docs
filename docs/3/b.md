# b. Planets

A Planet is the main territory of a Conqueror. Each conqueror will have one. Every facility built and every defense weapon built by a Defense System Building on the planet owned by a conqueror will be linked to the Planet. Planets will have levels, types, and rarities but wonâ€™t automatically be NFTs. That is where Genesis Planets will have their shared sink utility. Each Planet will have the possibility to change type and rarity by using Genesis Planets Seeds that will mainly be produced by Genesis Planets or that sometimes can be earned in a GTC found during an exploration expedition on the Great Galactic Line. Each Planet will have level, type, rarity, health, and attributes. The attributes are the following:

<ul>
    <li>
        Control (C): this attribute will determine the number of defense weapons your planet can control
    </li>
    <li>
        Health (H): this attribute will increase the health point of your planet
    </li>
    <li>
        Storage (S): this attribute will increase the GSS (Galactic Sea Stone) storage capacity of your planet
    </li>
</ul>

After each battle, the planet's Health point will decrease. Health Point(HP) can be restored using GSS or $GB. If Health points are never restored and after an attack, HP gets to zero, the attacking player will be able to destroy the facilities of a Planet and recycle 25% of the GSS used to build the facilities.

However, players will still be able to recover their facilities by spending GSS and $GB.

The Genesis planets will have five types: Fire, Water, Mountain, Jungle, Plain
Each planet type will have a synergy if associated with the right Conquerors.

These synergies will boost the attribute bonus of the Conquerors.

Here below a table to summarize the different synergies:

|Planet Type | Race Synergy |
|:------|------:|
|**Plain**|Human|
|**Fire**|Lunarian|
|**Mountain**|Giant|
|**Water**|Fishman|
|**Jungle**|Minks|

|Rarity | Bonus |
|:------|------:|
|**Common**|2%|
|**Uncommon**|5%|
|**Rare**|10%|
|**Epic**|15%|
|**Legendary**|20%|

This is how synergy will work. However, the new non-genesis Conqueror will initially have a neutral planet with no type. That is where our Genesis Planet shared sink utility comes into place. Other players will be able to change their planet type and rarity and will need a Genesis Planet Seed (GPS) of the type they want, to do so. Below, are the probability rates:

|GMB Rarity|Common Outcome|Uncommon Outcome|Rare Outcome|Epic Outcome|Legendary|
|-------------|------|--------|----|----|----|
|**Common**|96%|2%|1%|0.9%|0.1%|
|**Uncommon**|40%|55%|3%|1.8%|0.2%|
|**Rare**|30%|40%|27%|2%|1%|
|**Epic**|23%|27%|35%|13.5%|2.5%|
|**Legendary**|20%|22%|25%|28%|5%|

|GPS Type|Fire Outcome|Water Outcome|Mountain Outcome|Jungle Outcome|Plain Outcome|
|-------------|------|--------|----|----|----|
|**Fire**|60%|10%|10%|10%|10%|
|**Water**|10%|60%|10%|10%|10%|
|**Mountain**|10%|10%|60%|10%|10%|
|**Jungle**|10%|10%|10%|60%|10%|
|**Plain**|10%|10%|10%|10%|60%|

The number of the same type of GPS needed for the Planet Terraformation Process will be as the following:

|Rarity of Planet|Common GPS|Uncommon GPS|Epic GPS|Legendary GPS|
|-------------|------|--------|----|---|
|**Common**|5|6|7|8|9|
|**Uncommon**|4|5|6|7|8|
|**Rare**|3|4|5|6|7|
|**Epic**|2|3|4|5|6|
|**Legendary**|1|2|3|4|5|

The number of the same type of GPS needed for the Planet Terraformation Process will be as the following:

Mixed race can have synergy with both of his parent's planet type synergy. The Planet Terraformation Process (PTP) will cost $GB and use as many GPS as needed. Even Genesis Planet will be able to try PTP at their own risk.
