# c. Future collections

As evoked in the 2. b Value proposition, other collections are planned. These other collections will be new features and additions to the game, with once again great shared sink utilities. 

Galactic Blacksmith, who could create special weapons for Motherships, Galactic Alchemist that could handle precious stones worn by Conquerors to improve their innate attributes, the possibilities are endless but these will only see light after we reach some milestone in User Acquisitions.

The more players there are, the more intense each battle will be with more at stake as well. At that time new collections will make sense and will be extremely valuable for everyone playing Galactic Kingdom. So stay tuned.
