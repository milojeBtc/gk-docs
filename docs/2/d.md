# d. Conquerors Disciples

Almost the same as the Conqueror Descendants, Conquerors Disciples are disciples of a Genesis Conqueror (Male or Female). The process of training will be explained later on in the paper but here are the main differences between Disciples and Genesis
The initial attribute state will be similar to Descendants:

|Rarity|Minimun attribute|Maximun attribute |New point per level|
|-------------|------|--------|----|
|**Common**|1|8|6|
|**Uncommon**|7|16|8|
|**Rare**|14|32|10|
|**Epic**|28|64|12|
|**Legendary**|56|128|14|

The rarity bonus per race will be slightly inferior

|Rarity | Bonus |
|------|------|
|**Common**|1.5%|
|**Uncommon**|4.5%|
|**Rare**|9.5%|
|**Epic**|14.5%|
|**Legendary**|19.5%|

|Race | Aeribute concerned by the bonus |
|------|------|
|**Human**|Luck|
|**Lunarian**|Defense Power|
|**Giant**|Connection Speed|
|**Fishman**|Fleet Speed|
|**Minks**|Attack Power|

Conqueror Disciples will have the opportunity to pay to be adopted by their Genesis Conqueror Master and become Conqueror Descendants.

These are all the main characteristics of the player's Conquerors. Now letâ€™s move on to the two other main NFTs necessary for a conqueror to start his adventure.
