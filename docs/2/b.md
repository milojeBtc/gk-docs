# b. Value proposition

We believe that creating real and valuable utilities for our NFTs is fundamental to giving real sustainable value to holders, to Players, and to the game itself.

Most new crypto gaming projects with teams coming from Web 2 believe that early access to the game, direct access to the team, or being able to use your NFT in-game are great utilities while we know that this is just the bare minimum in Web 3. 

In our eyes, the only real utility for a gaming asset is a real direct correlation between, the success of the game and the value of the gaming asset.

To do that we went back into how traditional Web 2 free-to-play game made their money.

In Web 2, most of the revenue comes from IAPs(App Purchases), and you have the traditional sink-and-tap analogy to describe their game economy. Their game economy is based on balancing these sink and tap to have a balanced and enjoyable game, and then there will always be some players willing to pay for the tap to let out a little bit more. That is a very short generalized explanation of how Web 2 game economies and business models work.

Now for us, to ensure a direct correlation between the game success and the fundamental value of the NFTs, we take this sink-and-tap analogy and create shared sinks as utility.

In layman's terms, some necessary in-game features that players usually pay with their in-game currency directly to the game(or to NPCs) will now be shared with NFT holders instead and that is a game changer in creating a correlation between the game success and the NFT fundamental value. 

That is the spirit behind the utility of every single NFT in Galactic Kingdom and so here is a non-exhaustive list of all the benefits the Genesis Conquerors will have: 

<ul>
    <li>
        Breeding and Training: every breeding and training ( processes that will populate the game explained later on in this paper) will link back to one or two Genesis conquerors. This will be the biggest shared sink utility of the game, and this utility alone might be enough to make them one of, if not fundamentally the most valuable collection in Web 3 gaming.
    </li>
    <li>
        Airdrop: Genesis Conqueror will be airdropped NFTs from two other collections used in Galactic Kingdom that will also have great in-game shared sink utilities
    </li>
    <li>
        Governance: 10% of our future in-game governance token $GKC (Galactic Kingdom Citizen) will be airdropped daily for a year to every active Genesis Conqueror holder. ( Timeline and details TBD, more info on $GKC later in this paper)
    </li>
    <li>
        Future collection: Multiple future collections with great shared sink utilities are planned and waiting, but in any case, Genesis Conquerors holders will always have the opportunity to get some for free. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Pre-sale: Even after getting some free in-game assets, holders may want to participate even more and get even more of the future collection or more of our future governance token $GKC. All the Genesis Conquerors will be the first to have access rights to any of our pre-sale, the first one being the $GKC pre-sale (more details later in this paper) and we will go even further by giving Genesis Conqueror holders the possibility to tokenize and sell the totality or part of their pre-sale allocation rights, directly on the open market
    </li>
</ul>

These are the main benefits of Genesis Conquerors besides all the obvious things like early access to the game, a discord channel with the team, and all.
However, these will not be the only benefits Genesis Conquerors have. As a Holder-player-centric Team, every step of our development is focused on always creating more value for holders and players in every aspect.
