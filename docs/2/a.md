# a. Galactic Kingdom: Genesis Conquerors

The player character is a Conqueror. Conquerors are gaming assets on chain..

There will be three different collections of Conquerors : 

Genesis Conquerors: The first 10k collection that will give birth to Conqueror Descendants or train Conquerors Disciples (details on the two other collections will be given later on)

These conquerors will be divided into five races, five levels of rarity, three Factions, and two sexes 
The two sexes will be: Male & Female

The three Factions will be: Galactic Pirates, Galactic Revolutionary & Galactic Marines

The five rarities will be: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary

The five races will be: Human, Lunarian, Giants, Fishman, Minks

Five thousand of each sex.

Two thousand of each race.

Rarity will be distributed as follows: five thousand Common, two thousand Uncommon, one thousand and five hundred Rare, one thousand Epic, and five hundred Legendary.

Each conqueror will have five attributes that you’ll be able to increase as you level up.

These five attributes are:

<ul>
    <li>
        Defense power (DP): will increase the defense power of the planet owned by the conqueror
    </li>
    <li>
        Construction speed (SP): will increase the construction speed of anything on the planet owned by the conqueror
    </li>
    <li>
        Fleet Speed (FS): will increase the speed of the fleet owned by the conqueror reducing the time to reach another planet.
    </li>
    <li>
        Attack Power (AP): will increase the attack power of the fleet owned by the conqueror
    </li>
    <li>
        Luck(L): this will increase your probability of finding a rarer Galactic Treasure Chest (GTC) while exploring the Great Galactic Line and will increase your weight in the Galactic Berry($GB) shared pool for conquerors exploring. (GTC and GB will be explained later on in this paper)
    </li>
</ul>

Below is a table showing the different initial attributes depending on the rarity

| Rarity        | Minimun attribute | Maximun attribute | New point per level |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| **Common**    | 20                | 30                | 40                  |
| **Uncommon**  | 50                | 60                | 70                  |
| **Rare**      | 5                 | 8                 | 12                  |
| **Epic**      | 50                | 60                | 70                  |
| **Legendary** | 5                 | 8                 | 12                  |

Each Race has one attribute they specialize in so here below is the attribute bonus by race and rarity:

| Rarity        | Bonus |
| ------------- | ----- |
| **Common**    | 2%    |
| **Uncommon**  | 5%    |
| **Rare**      | 10%   |
| **Epic**      | 15%   |
| **Legendary** | 20%   |

| Race         | Aeribute concerned by the bonus |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| **Human**    | Luck                            |
| **Lunarian** | Defense Power                   |
| **Giant**    | Connection Speed                |
| **Fishman**  | Fleet Speed                     |
| **Minks**    | Attack Power                    |

For example, a Legendary Human Conqueror will have an increased initial Luck Attribute between 72+20%= 86,4 and 160+20%=192. His initial L will hence be between 86,4 and 192.

As shown in the first table each level, conquerors will get points to attribute between these 5 attributes.

The initial max level is 70. Leveling up will cost $GB and need some achievement like going on an expedition to explore the Great Galactic Line, or attacking other players. This is still to be determined but that is the vision.
