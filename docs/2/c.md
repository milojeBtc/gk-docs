# c. Conquerors Descendants

Conqueror descendants are the offspring of a Male Genesis Conqueror and a Female Genesis Conqueror. The process of breeding will be explained later on in the paper but here are the main differences between Descendants and Genesis:

The initial attribute state will be slightly inferior to Genesis:

| Rarity        | Minimun attribute | Maximun attribute | New point per level |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| **Common**    | 1                 | 8                 | 6                   |
| **Uncommon**  | 7                 | 16                | 8                   |
| **Rare**      | 14                | 32                | 10                  |
| **Epic**      | 28                | 64                | 12                  |
| **Legendary** | 56                | 128               | 14                  |

The rarity bonus per race will stay the same however mixed-race Descendants will have the Bonus applied to both of their parent race's special attributes.s

| Rarity        | Bonus |
| ------------- | ----- |
| **Common**    | 2%    |
| **Uncommon**  | 5%    |
| **Rare**      | 10%   |
| **Epic**      | 15%   |
| **Legendary** | 20%   |

| Race         | Attribute concerned by the bonus |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **Human**    | Luck                             |
| **Lunarian** | Defense Power                    |
| **Giant**    | Construction Speed               |
| **Fishman**  | Fleet Speed                      |
| **Minks**    | Attack Power                     |

For example for a Conqueror Descendant with a Human father and a Lunarian mother, the attribute bonus of rarity will apply on both Luck and Defense Power
