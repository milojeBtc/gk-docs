# i. Galactic Berry

Galactic Berry is the in-game currency of Galactic Kingdom. It will be a token on chain.

As exposed earlier,  $GB will be heavily taxed to ensure a continuous enjoyable experience for all players at all times.

$GB will be mainly earned in-game through Exploration Expedition on the Great Galactic Line or through trading GSS against it in the in-game marketplace. 

As stated earlier in the paper, the price and supply of $GB will be tightly controlled to maintain a healthy sustainable price. There will be a daily prize pool of $GB proportionally shared by all explorer under remunerated exploration expedition, depending on their total Luck compared to others.  After the full launch, this $GB price pool size will be halved regularly, the halving rhythm is still to be determined, and a better assessment will be made once alpha play with simulated money and game economy is done.

Players will also have the possibility to pay to mint $GB like they used to do in Web 2 games.

$GB will have a fixed total supply of two billion. This fixed supply has a soft cap since theoretically it could go beyond two billion but only if players keep on paying to mint. This scenario is highly advantageous for the game's longevity since most of the funds raised through this mean would directly contribute to the BTC reserve which then would create an even greater value for $GB

With that kind of fixed supply and all the different aspects of the economy, it is not necessary to burn $GB, instead all $GB used and paid to the game (level up, building, fees, etc) will be recycled and put back into the future $GB prize pools.

That way only the real circulating supply will be interesting to observe ( supply not owned on the Game) to manage the price and compare it with our BTC reserve.

Initially, there will be a small liquidity pool using a public Dex on chain that slowly will get others to provide liquidity on top by incentivizing them with $GKC, on top of liquidity-providing fees. But that will be the only external Dex used by the Galactic Kingdom just in the wait for our own tailored Dex directly in the app.

$GB will never provide any supply to be on any CEX. We want to avoid any form of speculation and even more leveraged speculation on our in-game currency since high price volatility hinders the game's enjoyability for players.

Through all that, we might be able to achieve our goal of having a relatively stable in-game currency
