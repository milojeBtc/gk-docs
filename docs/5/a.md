# g. The Thesis: a BTC-backed, player-centric in-game currency 

To this day, every Web 3 game that has already launched its in-game currency token, has chosen to follow a trust-based economy similar to the world we live in. In the real world, to make a long story short, fiat money is backed by nothing aside from trust in the economy of the country emitting it. Dollars are coupons, vouchers, and gift cards, usable in the big store called the United States of America and some other countries producing very valuable raw materials (Petrol) are accepting to get paid with these gift cards because they are the most accepted one.

Now, some would argue that this fiat-based economy is starting to die since quantitative easing( fancy word for inflation) was not that easing, and money printing finally isn’t that great. 

But at least, we can all admit that this economic model of the world did work for years and most likely will still work for some couple of years, and the reason is we have no other alternative yet.

This brings us to our Web 3 economies. Blindly imitating the real-world fiat model and using the old Web 2 game economy models in a Web 3 environment is like creating a simulation of our real-world economy but on steroids. What would happen if the dollar printing was even greater, faster, and spending even more restrained to just a very few things (your game here)? And what if on top of that people could instantly convert these dollars into another currency that is accepted everywhere and a hundred times more stable? 

Well, it wouldn’t be crazy to believe that the dollar’s value would plummet. And that is exactly what happened with the many in-game currencies we have known to this day. Yes, finding more sinks and having more control over the taps are good things but in the end, unless you are a game that can pretend to rival the real-world economy, and we believe these kinds of games will exist in the future, you won’t be able to balance this value extracting outflow that web 2 never had to face. That is why we need to go even further in the designing of our game economy, business model, and tokenomics and that is how we came up with a new in-game currency model based on an even older economic model than our world current one, a BTC backed in-game currency (inspired by the old gold standard). 

On paper, it sounds great. If the in-game currency is backed by something more than just the game sinks, its value would be way more sustainable. In-game earnings would then have real value on top of its in-game utility and every aspect of the game would be much more valuable, value creation easier and more sustainable.

But how can a game have a BTC ( or Gold or Stablecoins) backed in-game currency?

To do that we designed all our business model, game economy, and tokenomics around this single idea: creating a BTC reserve that could later on be redeemed with the in-game currency $GB

With that goal in mind, we intend to rely on heavy taxes on all value-extracting transactions. Value extracting is great but should not be easy, there is no such thing as free money and for us, the only way to ensure that no one is harmed in the process is by having tight control over the currency price. That’s why trying to speculate on our in-game currency $GB will be a bad experience. In the beginning, the only ones for whom buying $GB should be interesting are those who want to spend it in-game. Others might suffer great losses trying to speculate on it, especially during the period when BTC redeeming will not yet be available.

These heavy taxes will start from NFTs royalties and go all the way to transaction fees on dexes
To kickstart our Game Economy, a part of the money raised through the Genesis Conquerors’s Mint, a little more than 1 Million dollars, will be allocated to the BTC reserve and the Liquidity Pool of our in-game currency $GB.

Genesis Conquerors will have 25% royalties, of these 25%, 75% will go to the BTC reserve, and 25% to the Team Treasury.

Genesis Motherships and Planets being airdropped NFTs will have 50% royalties, of these 50 %, 75% will go to the BTC reserve, and 25% to the Team Treasury.

Breeding will be taxed on GCLF, if you buy GCLF from another player 75% will be paid to the player and 25% will be taxed, of these 25%, 75% will go to the BTC reserve, 25% to the Team Treasury. On top of the GLCF price, there will be an in-game process fee to fuse the two GCLFs with the DCBP.

If you breed with your GCLFs you’ll only pay 25% of the GCLFs-based price as a fee, with no fee for fusing on top.

For the game enjoyability and in-game price stability, most in-game transactions besides the breeding one above won’t be taxed.

However, there will be a 50% Tax on the $GB outflow ( from in-game to on-chain)
There might also be a variable bid-ask spread on the $GB decentralized liquidity pool directly built into the smart contract. The goal here is that when the BTC reserve is high enough there will be no need for a big bid-ask spread since the ability to redeem BTC will open an arbitrage opportunity that will allow the price to self-regulate on the open market.

On top of being able to redeem BTC against $GB, players will also be able to directly buy/mint $GB from us. Basically, in the Web 2 game, all in-game currency purchases were going to the game studio. That was their main income, their business model. Here we take this model and we use it to fuel even more of the $GB BTC reserve. This will also allow us to take payment in fiat letting players use Google Pay and Apple Pay even more seamlessly. It will be more expensive for them to pay through these methods since Google and Apple will also take their cut, but the ease of payment is also great. Here again, 75% will go to the BTC reserve, and 25% to the Team Treasury.

This buy/mint function will also be implemented to avoid a huge price surge in the token price and instead, if players want to buy a consequent amount they go through us at a fixed price and it benefits everyone long term.

That is the main thesis behind our in-game currency model and how we will create the first-ever BTC-backed in-game currency.
