# h. Galactic Sea Stone

Galactic Sea Stone is the main resource needed for building anything on the planet, from facilities to spaceships to defense weapons. Everything will need this great material that GSS is.

GSS will be earned by building a GSS miner on your planet. This will be the first and most important building youâ€™ll be able to build.

GSS Miners will have levels(like every other facility on the planet) and each level will increase the GSS output on the planet.

There will be a capacity limit on how much GSS can be stored on one planet to avoid any inactivity.

The GSS mining rate is still to be determined but it is good to know that GSS will also be tradeable against $GB of other players on the in-game marketplace or sometime directly sold to the Galactic Government against $GB.

A fixed quantity of $GB will be available for that.

GSS will be a completely off-chain resource.
