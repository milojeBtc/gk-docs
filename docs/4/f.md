# f. One Peace?

Finally, One Peace? What is it? A treasure? A Legacy? A Utopia? Does it even exist? So many questions, that everyone in the universe is asking. The Galactic Government doesn’t want its citizens to even think about it.

“ Not long ago, some information leaked from an anonymous source who pretended to have once served as an Admiral under the direct command of the Galactic Government.

He just said: « One Peace is real! The clues to find it are hidden on the Great Galactic Line »
Maybe it was also he who spread this story about the King of the Ancient Great Galactic Kingdom and his words.

All I know is that I want to start my adventure, find that One Peace, and inherit the kingdom“
