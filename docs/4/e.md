# e. Galactic Treasure Chest

Galaxy Treasure Chest. Only found on the Great Galactic Line. Nowhere else. How to get there? That’s the second main feature of Galactic Kingdom, aside from the thrilling attacking feature, you’ll be able to take the game out in real life, by going for a walk with your fleet and trying to find some Galactic Treasure Chests, these famous GTC where every valuable treasure in the universe could be found.

You can spend as long as you want in the Great Galactic Line, but don’t forget your planets in the meantime, and be ready to battle if you ever encounter another Conqueror on your way.

Here below is a non-exhaustive list of what can be found in a GTC:

<ul>
    <li>
        Planet Coordinates
    </li>
    <li>
        Genesis Planet Seeds ( of all types and rarities)
    </li>
    <li>
        Genesis Mothership Blueprints ( of all types of rarity)
    </li>
    <li>
        Various Spaceship Blueprints ( will unlock certain types of spaceship in your Planet’s shipyard; of all types of rarity)
    </li>
    <li>
        Various Defenses Weapons Blueprints( will unlock certain types of Defense Weapons in your Planet’s Defense System Building, of all types of rarity)
    </li>
    <li>
        Galactic Sea Stone (GSS)
    </li>
    <li>
        Galactic Berry ($GB)
    </li>
</ul>

Spending time in the Great Galactic Line in search of GTC has no limit. Not necessarily the wisest choice but at least you spend time outside. However, the Exploration Expedition on the Great Galactic Line can also be greatly remunerated by the Galactic Government. Every day they are offering a fixed amount of $GB for all the explorers to share. But this remunerated exploration will be limited to a grand maximum of 1h30 twice a day.

On top of that Genesis Conqueror will only get their daily $GKC allocation if they spend all their total fuel point at least once a day.

This will be the main way to earn $GB in-game. Your share will be calculated each minute according to your total Luck Size compared to all the other players exploring at the same time.

The time you can spend as a GG remunerated explorer depends on your total fuel. Fuel is reset twice a day, the first time at 5 am UTC and the second time at 5 pm UTC.

Here below is your total fuel and the time you can spend out depending on the number of planets you own.

| ----------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
