    "description": "Having great utilities for Genesis Holders, by creating shared sinks is wonderful, but if the game economy the Business Model the tokenomics, or the User Acquisition Strategy are bad then shared sinks or not, everything will be almost worthless. That is why the creation of these shared sinks was done simultaneously with User Acquisition, Game Economy, and Tokenomics in mind. With these foundations firmly built in a new innovative way Galactic Kingdom is aiming to set a new standard for the whole sector. So letâ€™s dig into these aspects by looking at the main features of the game, their impacts on the game economy, User Acquisition, and our Business Model then later on we will dig deeper into our game-changing Tokenomics."
