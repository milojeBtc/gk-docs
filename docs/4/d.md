# d. Attacking /Conquering

Besides our new breeding and training model, with Galactic Kingdom, we have designed the game features in a way that will, be fun, benefit the economy, and also avoid any boring farming type of play that only extract from the game.

That is why Conqueror will be able to attack other planets owned by other conquerors, most details of the game attack mechanism won’t be revealed in this paper but essentially all the GSS and $GB earned in-game won’t be directly on-chain, but only distributed around once a week (TBD) during a more or less short time window. At that moment only, players will be able to extract from the game the balance of $GB, send it to their on-chain wallet, and trade it on the open market if they want. 

That way, most of the time, your unspent earnings are at risk on your planets and you could be the target of one or many other Conquerors.

This will bring a lot of thrill to the game, and push for guilds and alliances to form. This is why the player will want to keep on improving their planets, their defenses, their fleets, and increasing the size of their Empire.

Players will be able to conquer new planets and in consequence drastically increase their GSS productions, their fleet power, and even their total Luck during exploration expeditions on the Great Galactic Line, which in turn will increase their $GB earning and their GTC drop rate.

To conquer a new planet players will need a new Conqueror Descendant. If you are a Disciple you need first to become a Descendant. If you are already a Descendant or a Genesis, you’ll need either two GCLF (one male and one female) that you can get from other Genesis Conquerors or use your Lineage factor if you are a Genesis Conqueror and get only one other GCLF if you don’t have an opposite sex available.

Then with this new Conqueror, you’ll receive a basic Mothership. You can choose to let it be basic like that or go through the MEP explained earlier.

Then you’ll need Planet Coordinates. Planet Coordinates can be found in GTC on the Great Galactic Line.
And finally, with these Planet Coordinates, you’ll be able to send your new Conqueror Descendants with his mothership to colonize a new planet and start the building processes. If he wants, players can also do the PTP.

This conquering process is only available for already playing players. New players will directly receive a basic Mothership and a basic Planet for starters.
